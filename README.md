# wp-upgrade-jquery

This Wordpress plugin upgrades jQuery to the latest version, currently **v3.4.1**. It has no configuration options. Simply enable the plugin, and your site will use the latest version of jQuery. Since this plugin makes no changes to core WordPress files, you can just disable to go back to the default version.

Wordpress uses an outdated version of jQuery by default. Using Google's Lighthouse tool will reveal this version of jQuery has known security vulnerabilies. If your site doesn't use any outdated plugins that depend on the old version of jQuery, you can fix this error using this plugin.

We use this plugin at [Bidwell Websites](https://bidwellwebsites.com) to ensure our clients' sites are free from security vulnerabilities.
